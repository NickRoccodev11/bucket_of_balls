#Bucket-O-Balls

- You've got two buckets and bunch of colored balls. select the balls you want to remove from one bucket and put in the other bucket. That's it! very relaxing.

-This project demonstates the use of React, specifically managing state, passing props, conditional rendering , as well as some nifty  abstraction and encapsulation of logic.
